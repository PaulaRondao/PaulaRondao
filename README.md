### How I work 

My motivation is to create robustness and clarity in my web projects using my curiosity and determination to always strive for excellence.   
I seek to strike a balance between creativity and responsibility in establishing the necessary processes to achieve my goals, hoping to find the right measure.   
As my mind works in a branching manner, I particularly appreciate breaking down the various steps of a process in writing to aid me in this approach, progressing step by step.
